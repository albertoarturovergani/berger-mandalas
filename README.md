Berger mandala is an artwork inspired by German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873-1941), who in 1924, exactly 100 years ago, made the first recording of an electrical brain signal in humans using a string galvanometer . He later made hundreds of recordings through the development of an improved device that he later called the "Elektrenkephalogramm," i.e., today's electroencephalogram (EEG). 

EEG signals are usually represented temporally in a Cartesian coordinate system. If these, on the other hand, are represented in a polar coordinate system, the periodicity of the voltage amplitudes draws complex patterns that can be traced back to the shapes that mandalas have, i.e., endowed with regularity and order, inherent in this case in the temporal structure of the brain electrical signal. 

In particular, the artwork presented here aimed to honor the centenary of Berger's first recording by representing exactly one hundred brain recordings, from the EEG dataset TDBRAIN of the Bainclinics foundation (https://brainclinics.com/resources/), from whose website one can access free of charge a thousand EEG recordings from psychiatric patients in a resting condition, as well as download the original Hans Berger publications produced in the years from 1900-1938. 

The process of transforming EEG signals from Catastrophic to polar coordinates is documented on the github page on Berger mandala artwork (https://github.com/albertoarturovergani/berger-mandala).
