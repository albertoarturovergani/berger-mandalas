The "Berger Mandalas" is an artistic creation inspired by the groundbreaking work of German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873-1941). In 1924, exactly a century ago, at University of Jena, Berger achieved a significant milestone by recording the first electrical brain signal in humans using a string galvanometer. He continued to refine his techniques, eventually developing an improved device known as the "Elektrenkephalogramm," which laid the foundation for today's electroencephalogram (EEG).

Traditionally, EEG signals are depicted in a Cartesian coordinate system, reflecting their temporal characteristics. However, when represented in a polar coordinate system, the periodicity of voltage amplitudes gives rise to intricate patterns reminiscent of mandalas. These patterns, characterized by regularity and order, mirror the underlying temporal structure of the brain's electrical signals. 

The artwork showcased here celebrates the centenary of Berger's pioneering achievement by visually representing exactly 100 EEG recordings. These recordings are from resting state condition sourced from the TDBRAIN dataset, made available by the Bainclinics foundation webpage (https://brainclinics.com/resources/), which also offers access to original publications by Hans Berger spanning the years 1900 to 1938.

The natural dimensions of the artwork are in A0 format at 750 DPI. The color palettes utilized are randomly selected from a pool of 100 palettes and assigned to each EEG pattern mandala. The proportions between the sides adhere to a pyramidal sequence. The EEG preprocessing and transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates, along with the code to generate the artwork, are documented on https://github.com/albertoarturovergani/berger-mandalas. It is interesting to note that the composition of 100 Berger mandalas might also be observed as a one stand-alone large Berger mandala, evoking a hierarchy of periodic spatial structures.
