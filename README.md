The Berger Mandala is an artistic creation inspired by the groundbreaking work of German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873-1941). In 1924, exactly a century ago, Berger achieved a significant milestone by recording the first electrical brain signal in humans using a string galvanometer. He continued to refine his techniques, eventually developing an improved device known as the "Elektrenkephalogramm," which laid the foundation for today's electroencephalogram (EEG).

Traditionally, EEG signals are depicted in a Cartesian coordinate system, reflecting their temporal characteristics. However, when represented in a polar coordinate system, the periodicity of voltage amplitudes gives rise to intricate patterns reminiscent of mandalas. These patterns, characterized by regularity and order, mirror the underlying temporal structure of the brain's electrical signals.

The artwork showcased here celebrates the centenary of Berger's pioneering achievement by visually representing exactly one hundred EEG recordings. These recordings are from resting state condition sourced from the TDBRAIN dataset, made available by the Bainclinics foundation webpage (https://brainclinics.com/resources/), which also offers access to original publications by Hans Berger spanning the years 1900 to 1938.

The EEG preprocessing and transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates are detailed in the documentation available on the GitHub page for the Berger Mandala artwork project, accessible at https://github.com/albertoarturovergani/berger-mandala. The color palettes used in the artwork are selected randomly from a pool of 100 palettes and assigned to each EEG pattern mandala. The proportions between the sides follow a pyramidal sequence. The natural dimensions of the artwork are in A0 format at 1000 DPI.
