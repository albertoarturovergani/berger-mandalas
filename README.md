The Berger Mandala is an artistic creation inspired by the groundbreaking work of German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873-1941). In 1924, exactly a century ago, Berger achieved a significant milestone by recording the first electrical brain signal in humans using a string galvanometer. He continued to refine his techniques, eventually developing an improved device known as the "Elektrenkephalogramm," which laid the foundation for today's electroencephalogram (EEG).

Traditionally, EEG signals are depicted in a Cartesian coordinate system, reflecting their temporal characteristics. However, when represented in a polar coordinate system, the periodicity of voltage amplitudes gives rise to intricate patterns reminiscent of mandalas. These patterns, characterized by regularity and order, mirror the underlying temporal structure of the brain's electrical signals.

The artwork showcased here celebrates the centenary of Berger's pioneering achievement by visually representing one hundred EEG recordings. These recordings are from resting state condition sourced from the TDBRAIN dataset, made available by the Bainclinics foundation webpage (https://brainclinics.com/resources/), which also offers access to original publications by Hans Berger spanning the years 1900 to 1938.

The process of transforming EEG signals from Cartesian to polar coordinates is documented on the Berger Mandala artwork's GitHub page at https://github.com/albertoarturovergani/berger-mandala. The colour palettes are a combination of a selection of colour mixtures, the sizes of the mandalas as well as their positions are arranged according to random factors.
