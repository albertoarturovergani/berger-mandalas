The "Berger Mandalas" represent an artistic homage to the groundbreaking research of German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873-1941). A century ago, in 1924, at the University of Jena, Berger achieved a significant milestone by recording the first electrical brain signal in humans using a string galvanometer. His relentless refinement of techniques led to the development of the "Elektrenkephalogramm," laying the foundation for modern electroencephalography (EEG).

Traditionally, EEG signals are graphed in a Cartesian coordinate system to capture their temporal dynamics. However, when depicted in a polar coordinate system, the periodic voltage amplitudes yield intricate patterns reminiscent of mandalas. These patterns, characterized by their regularity and order, mirror the underlying temporal structure of the brain's electrical activity.

The artwork presented here commemorates the centenary of Berger's pioneering achievement by visually representing exactly 100 EEG recordings. These recordings are sourced from the resting state condition of the TDBRAIN dataset, available through the Bainclinics foundation webpage (https://brainclinics.com/resources/), which also provides access to original publications by Hans Berger from 1900 to 1938.

The artwork's natural dimensions adhere to the A0 format at 750 DPI. Color palettes are randomly selected from a pool of 100 options and assigned to each EEG pattern mandala. Proportions between the sides follow a pyramidal sequence.

Documentation detailing EEG preprocessing and the transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates, along with the code for generating the artwork, is available at https://github.com/albertoarturovergani/berger-mandalas. It's noteworthy that the composition of 100 Berger mandalas can also be perceived as a single stand-alone large Berger mandala, evoking various hierarchies of periodic spatial structures.
